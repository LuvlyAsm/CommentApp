			COMMENT APP
			------------------------


1.In this Project I used HTML,CSS,JSP,SERVLET,MYSQL database,JDBC Connectivity and Tomcat server as well
2.I configured tomcat server in my eclipse j2ee
3.And also I configured MySQL Workbench   and also created table called "Cridential" to save email,password,secret code. and also created table called "comments" to store email and comments
4.I imported needed jar files and sql connector 

5.It has 4 parts
6.index.jsp,forgot-Password.jsp,index-redirect.jsp,welcome.jsp
7.And I also configured those jsp pages to the Servlets to hide the operations
8.When clicking LogIn from index.jsp,it will go to the Validation.java which is acts as servlet
9.In that Validation.java Servlet,I created a JDBC Connection which will fetch the details from MySQL DB.
10.After that I wrote a If condition to check the details.if the pasword matches,the welcome page will be called.else it will be redirect to index-redirect.jsp
11.index-redirect.jsp is nothing but the same index page with error message
12.When you click forgot password Forgot-Password.jsp will be called
13.and after giving secret code i will be called the servlet
14.servlet will give password if email and secret code matches
15.when you give signup,it will call signup.jsp
16.here also i wrote a jdbc connection store those values into Database
17.Then after successful signup,the welcome page should be called
18.In welcome page we can write comment
19.There also I wrote a jdbc steps to storevthose comments in the table called "comments"
20.Thats all. Thanks You
